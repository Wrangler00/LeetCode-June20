Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

//c++

class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        int ss = s.size();
        
        for(int i=ss-1;i>=ss/2;i--){
            char temp = s[i];
            s[i] = s[ss-i-1];
            s[ss-i-1] = temp;
        }

    }
};
